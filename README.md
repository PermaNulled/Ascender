# Ascender
Server emulator for Ascend: Hand of Kul

## Introduction
This is currently a information sharing page/repository for the game Ascend: Hand of Kul.

Our (my?) goal is to create a local server for the game, since the official server has closed in 2016.

Think of Mooege or Vindictus Offline (I think?).
